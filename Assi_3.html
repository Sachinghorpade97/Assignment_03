                <header id="head">JavaScript and Java</header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java have some similarities, but they are fundamentally different overall. The
                    JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have
                    Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
                    naming
                    conventions, and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the Java compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types
                    representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
                    instead
                    of the more common class-based object model.
                    The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance: what is inherited can vary for individual
                    objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
                    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do have to declare all variables,
                    classes,
                    and methods. You have to be concerned about which
                    methods are public, private, or protected. Also, you have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad, and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>

                  greetMe("World");

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>

                <header id="head">Declaring variable</header>
                <p> When you declare a variable outside of any function. it is called a local variabl it is available to
                    any other code in the currrent docoument when you declare a variable with in function it is called
                    as local variable becous it is avilable only wothin that function.</p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 dose not have block statement scope a variable decleare within a
                    bloak is local to the function for global scope that the block reside within for exampel the
                    following code will long 25 becouse the scope of x is the function for the globel context within x
                    is declare no the block which is not case and if statement</p>
                <code class="cod">if(true){var x=5:}console.log(x)://5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes with using the let decoration in ECMSScript 2015</p>

        <section id="Variable scope">
            <header id="head">Variable scope</header>
            <p>When declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript befre ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope rather, a variable declared
                within a block is local to the function global scope that the block resides within. For example the
                following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function for global contex within which x
                is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

        <div class="main-section">
            <section id="Global variables">
                <header id="head">Global variables</header>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set and access global variables using the window variable syntax</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                    frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phone Number is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <div class="main-section">
            <section id="Constants">
                <header id="head">Constants</header>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign and can contain alphabetic,or underscore character.</p>
                <code class="cod">const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
                    has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
                    keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
                    example:</p>
                <code class="cod">/ THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {};const f = 5;// THIS WILL 
                    CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO func const g = 5; var g;//statements
              }
              </code>
                <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                    problems.</p>
                <code class="cod">const my object={"key":"value"};
                    my object.key ="othervValue";

        <div class="main-section">

                <header id="head">Data types</header>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive null is
                            not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol new in ECMAScript 2015[]. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable</li>
                        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
                            functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements
                            in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                            procedures that your application can perform.</p>
            </section>
        </div>

        <div class="main-section">
            <section id="if.else statement">
                <header id="head">if.else statement</header>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code class="cod">if (condition) {statement 1;} else {statement 2; }</code>
                <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
                    what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
                    otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including
                    further nested if statements.</p>
                <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                    follows:</p>
                <code class="cod">
                  if (condition 1) {statement 1} else if (condition 2) {statement 2;}<br> else if (condition n) {tatement n} else statement last;}
                </code>
                <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                    executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                    general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                </p>
                <code class="cod">
                  if (condition) {statement 1 runs if condition is true;<br>
                     statement 2 runs if condition is true; else <br>
                     {statement 4 runs if condition is false;}
                </code>
                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can
                    be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                </p>
                <code class="cod">if (x=y){statement here}
               </code>
                <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                    parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
                <code class="cod">
                  if ((x=y)) {/* statements here */}
                </code>

        <div class="main-section">
            <section id="while statement">
                <header id="head">while statement</header>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
                    statement looks as follows:</p>
                <code class="cod">while (condition) statement</code>
                <p>the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following the loop.</p>
                <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                    statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
                <p>example</p>
                <p>the following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
                <code class="cod">
                 var n=0; var x=0; while (n3) { n++; x += n;}
               </code>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                    following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>after the first pass: n=1 and x=1</li>
                    <li>after the second pass: n=2 and x=3</li>
                    <li>after the third pass: n=3 and x=6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>after completing the third pass, the condition n 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>

                <header id="head">Function declarations</header>
                <p>function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword, followed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the name of the function.</li>
                    <li>a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                    <li>the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>for example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                <code class="cod">
                  function square(number) { return number * number;}
                </code>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                    statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                <code class="cod">
                  return number * number
                </code>
                <p>primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally or in the calling function.</p>
