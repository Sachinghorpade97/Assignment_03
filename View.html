      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript and Java have some similarities, but they are fundamentally different overall. The
          JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,
          naming
          conventions, and basic control-flow constructs
          which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Java compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
          runtime system based on a small number of data types
          representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model
          instead
          of the more common class-based object model.
          The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance: what is inherited can vary for individual
          objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
          methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do have to declare all variables,
          classes,
          and methods. You have to be concerned about which
          methods are public, private, or protected. Also, you have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.The names of variables, called
          identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
          characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
          characters "A" through (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
          Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
          temp99, and name.</p>

        <p>When declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is

        <p>JavaScript befre ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope rather, a variable declared
          within a block is local to the function global scope that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function for global contex within which x
          is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
          window, so you can set and access global variables using the window variable syntax</p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
          frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phone Number is
          declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

      <article>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
          identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
          dollar sign and can contain alphabetic,or underscore character.</p>
        <code class="cod">const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
          has to be initialized to a value.</p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const
          keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For
          example:</p>
        <code class="cod">/ THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {};const f = 5;// THIS WILL 
          CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO func const g = 5; var g;//statements
    }
    </code>
        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
          problems.</p>
        <code class="cod">const my object={"key":"value"};

      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive null is
              not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>Symbol new in ECMAScript 2015[]. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable</li>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
              functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements
              in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
              procedures that your application can perform.</p>

      </h1>
      <article>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
          clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code class="cod">if (condition) {statement 1;} else {statement 2; }</code>
        <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of
          what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed;
          otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including
          further nested if statements.</p>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
          follows:</p>
        <code class="cod">
        if (condition 1) {statement 1} else if (condition 2) {statement 2;}<br> else if (condition n) {tatement n} else statement last;}
      </code>
        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
          executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
        </p>
        <code class="cod">
        if (condition) {statement 1 runs if condition is true;<br>
           statement 2 runs if condition is true; else <br>
           {statement 4 runs if condition is false;}
      </code>
        <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can
          be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        </p>

      </h1>
      <article>
        <header id="head">while statement</header>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
          statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code class="cod">while (condition) statement</code>
        <p>the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
          statement following the loop.</p>
        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
          statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
          stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>
        <p>example</p>
        <p>the following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
        <code class="cod">
         var n=0; var x=0; while (n3) { n++; x += n;}
       </code>
        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
          following values:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>after the first pass: n=1 and x=1</li>
          <li>after the second pass: n=2 and x=3</li>
          <li>after the third pass: n=3 and x=6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>after completing the third pass, the condition n 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
